Project Name: Spotify Clone 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is a front-end project that i took up to learn front-end web development. Ive tried to mimic the working
 of the Spotify web player using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. Most of the playlists are just placeholders and 
 are not working links to songs. Some of the songs that do play are being directed from my personal google drive. 
 All logos are trademark of Spotify. THis project was not meant for any commercial use.
